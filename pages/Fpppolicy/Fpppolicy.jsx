            You can place orders to buy the Products and/or Services

            <h5>WHAT IS THE POLICY FOR FEES AND PAYMENTS?</h5>
            <p>
              The Terms and Conditions [available at
              https://www.Meddtoday.com/terms-and-conditions] and this Fees and
              Payments Policy ("FPP Policy") define Grand Care Health
              Technologies's policies and processes regarding the acceptance of
              fees and payments for the services made available through the
              Website. The main goal of Grand Care Health Technologies is to
              make sure that the Website is user-friendly and has the security
              architecture that can be reasonably expected to safeguard any
              financial information that a user might share.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users must read this FPP Policy carefully and comprehend all of
              its provisions. You are urged not to accept the Provisions of Use
              and this FPP Policy and to immediately stop using the Website if
              you do not agree with its terms. The terms in this FPP Policy must
              be acknowledged in their entirety, and by using, browsing,
              accessing, or making purchases on this website, you consent to
              being bound by their provisions.
            </p>

            <h5>Options for fees and payments</h5>
            <p>
              1. There is no charge from Grand Care Health Technologies to
              access the website. In the future, Grand Care Health Technologies
              may think about charging the User a charge for using the Website
              in its entirety or for using services. In such a case, you agree
              to pay any necessary expenses. Grand Care Health Technologies does
              not promise or guarantee that it would give you notice before
              executing such a charge levy. Your continuing usage of the Website
              after such change in the fees will be regarded to constitute your
              acceptance of such changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Grand Care Health Technologies gives the user a variety of
              payment alternatives to ensure their convenience. Without giving
              the user prior notice, Grand Care Health Technologies maintains
              the right to add or remove any of the following payment methods:
            </p>
            <p className="mb-0">Payment options include </p>
            <p className="mb-0">a. using net banking services; </p>
            <p className="mb-0">b. using specific credit or debit cards; </p>
            <p className="mb-0">c. using specific debit cards; </p>
            <p className="mb-0">d. using the Meddtoday Wallet; </p>
            <p className="mb-0">e. using cash on delivery; </p>
            <p>
              f. using prepaid payment instruments and electronic wallets; and{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              g. using any other payment method that Grand Care Health
              Technologies may offer from time to time. The term "Payment
              Choices" will be used going forward to refer to all of the
              aforementioned payment options. Grand Care Health Technologies
              currently only accepts payments from a select few major banking
              channels, despite fair efforts to offer the Payment Options
              through several financial channels. International debit/credit
              card payments are not accepted by Grand Care Health Technologies.
            </p>

            <p>
              3. It is specifically stated that Grand Care Health Technologies
              has the exclusive discretion to accept a User's payment made using
              the Payment Options. For whatever reason, Grand Care Health
              Technologies retains the right to refuse payment from a User using
              the Payment Options. Grand Care Health Technologies retains the
              right to refuse a User's payment made through the Payment Options
              if the User does not provide a copy of their photo identity
              evidence, such as their PAN card, in order to further confirm
              their transaction.
            </p>

            <p>
              4. The user agrees to submit true, correct, and complete financial
              information when using the payment options, including credit/debit
              card information and prepaid payment instrument account
              information, which may be saved by Grand Care Health
              Technologies's third-party payment gateway provider. Users are not
              permitted to use credit/debit cards or prepaid items that they do
              not legitimately own or are not authorised to use. The security
              and confidentiality of the User's financial information shall be
              completely his or her responsibility. Grand Care Health
              Technologies disclaims all responsibility for any damages that may
              result from the unauthorised use of the User's identity or
              financial information, including information pertaining to the
              Payment Options.
            </p>

            <p>
              5. Grand Care Health Technologies disclaims all responsibility and
              liability for any loss or harm a user may experience as a result
              of:{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              a. Transactions that were not authorised, including those made
              with gift cards and vouchers given to users as part of Grand Care
              Health Technologies promotions.
            </p>
            <p>
              b. Exceeding the credit/debit limit that the User and the issuing
              bank had previously mutually agreed upon.
            </p>

            <p>
              c. Any payment problems brought on by errors in the transaction's
              technology.
            </p>

            <p>
              d. Transactions that are refused for causes outside of Grand Care
              Health Technologies's control.
            </p>

            <p>
              6. Grand Care Health Technologies retains the right to place
              restrictions on how many transactions a User may carry out using
              the Website. Grand Care Health Technologies maintains the right to
              refuse to accept any transactions coming from Users who have a
              suspicious or questionable transaction history on the Website,
              should the User go above the transaction limitations set by Grand
              Care Health Technologies. Grand Care Health Technologies has the
              right to refuse such transactions if it is unsatisfied with a
              User's reliability or the veracity of a transaction made on the
              Website. In its sole discretion, Grand Care Health Technologies
              may also decide to postpone or refuse to ship the Products that
              the User has purchased. The User acknowledges and accepts that
              Grand Care Health Technologies shall not be liable for any harm,
              interests, or claims due to Grand Care Health Technologies's
              decision to refuse to conduct a transaction or delay in executing
              a transaction due to a User's suspicious behaviour on the Website.
            </p>

            <p>
              7. All of the Products that are displayed on the Platform include
              all applicable taxes. All fees, costs, and charges related to
              purchasing products from us will be your responsibility to pay,
              and you agree to cover all applicable taxes, including but not
              limited to VAT/CST, service tax, GST, duties, and cessers. Despite
              Grand Care Health Technologies's best efforts, there may be
              occasions where Products are mispriced on the Website before,
              during, or after the User has completed the purchase process.
              Although careful verification procedures are followed before
              Product prices are published on the Website, errors and
              discrepancies resulting from technological difficulties and delays
              are inevitable. For the avoidance of doubt, Grand Care Health
              Technologies's corrective measures are listed below in the case
              that the actual maximum retail price of a product differs from the
              price listed on the website:
            </p>

            <p>
              i. The User shall notify us at cs@Meddtoday.com within 2 (two)
              days of the time he/she received the Products if the maximum
              retail price of the Products provided to the User is less than the
              price advertised on the Website. The difference between the
              purchase price and the maximum retail price will be refunded to
              the user's wallet account or transferred to the user's bank
              account within 10 (ten) to 12 (twelve) working days of the date
              Grand Care Health Technologies receives the user's written
              request, provided that Grand Care Health Technologies is satisfied
              with the user's claim.
            </p>

            <p>
              ii. Grand Care Health Technologies reserves the right to hold off
              on shipping the purchased Products until the Website's error has
              been fixed and the User has paid the difference in price. This
              applies if the maximum retail price of the Products listed on the
              Website is higher than what has been published and Grand Care
              Health Technologies is not offering an offer or discount on such
              Products. If the User declines to pay the difference amount, the
              User may request a cancellation, and Grand Care Health
              Technologies will reimburse the User's payment in 10 (ten) working
              days to their wallet account or transfer it to their bank account.
            </p>

            <p>
              iii. The User will need to submit an email to us at
              cs@Meddtoday.com with the information of the bank account where
              the money needs to be repaid in order for us to conduct such
              refunds. If the User first paid for the order using "cash on
              delivery," they will then receive a refund to their net banking
              account. If the initial method of payment for the order was
              something other than "cash on delivery," we might send the refund
              to the User's source account.
            </p>
            <p>
              8. In addition to this FPP Policy, the terms and conditions of the
              User's bank, relevant financial institution, and/or card issuing
              association may be applicable to allow User to make payments for
              Products purchased on the Website. Grand Care Health Technologies
              does not regulate this and is therefore not responsible at any
              time. The User's bank, financial institution, or card issuing
              association may reject or prohibit the User from making electronic
              payments for purchasing the Products on the Website.
            </p>

            <p>
              9. In accordance with the applicable Indian legislation, Grand
              Care Health Technologies may occasionally enter into contracts
              with third-party payment service providers, including banks.
            </p>

            <p>
              10. The User is first required to confirm whether his or her
              family members, friends, or coworkers were authorised to carry out
              the purchase of Products on the Website if it is made clear to the
              User that a charge has been created on his or her payment
              instrument(s) for the purchase of Products on the Website and the
              User is unaware of such purchase on the Website. If, despite this,
              the user is still unable to identify the charge that was made on
              his or her payment instrument(s) for the purchase of Products on
              the Website, the user may report such an unauthorised purchase to
              us within 2 (two) days of the date on which it was made on the
              Website in order to allow Grand Care Health Technologies to start
              an investigation.
            </p>

            <p>
              11. Grand Care Health Technologies retains the right to reclaim
              the invalidated payment ("Invalidated Payment") from the User's
              Wallet Account if the User makes a transaction on the Website and
              the payment substitute has been deemed invalid. If the user does
              not have enough money in their wallet to permit the redemption of
              the invalidated payment, they must send the invalidated payment to
              Grand Care Health Technologies's bank account, the information for
              which will be provided in the written notice, within 2 to 4
              working days after receiving it. Despite receiving the warning, if
              the User does not deposit the Invalidated Payment into Grand Care
              Health Technologies's bank account, Grand Care Health Technologies
              will be able to take the defaulting User to court at the
              defaulting User's expense and risk.
            </p>

            <p>
              12. The "cash on delivery" payment option enables Users to pay our
              delivery representative or logistic partner in cash only at the
              time the bought Products are delivered to the User. Currently, our
              cash on delivery payment option has a maximum order value of INR
              10,000 (Indian Rupees ten thousand). Grand Care Health
              Technologies retains the right to refuse to accept cash on
              delivery payments for particular Products (which could be Products
              that Grand Care Health Technologies specifies or Products whose
              value exceeds a certain threshold) or places. The Return Refund
              and Cancellation Policy, which outlines the conditions for refunds
              for transactions completed using the cash on delivery payment
              option, must be read and accepted by the user(s).
            </p>

            <p>
              13. Meddtoday Wallet: In the event that a User cancels an order
              for which Grand Care Health Technologies has already received
              money, the User will have the option of converting the order
              payment into Meddtoday Wallet. Additionally, all refunds for
              products purchased using the "cash on delivery" payment option
              will be transferred as Meddtoday Wallet into the User's Wallet
              account, and any unused Wallet funds will be returned to the
              source account in the event that the User expresses an intention
              to deactivate his or her account. Users may receive Meddtoday
              Wallet from Grand Care Health Technologies based solely on its
              judgement. The user may only make future purchases using the
              Wallets on the Website. Grand Care Health Technologies will not be
              compelled to handle any refunds in any way if a User decides to
              cancel his or her account with the company. The User understands
              that any Wallet granted by Grand Care Health Technologies that is
              present on the User's Wallet account, if any, would automatically
              stand forfeited. As a result, the User consents to utilise and use
              up any available Wallet before asking to have his or her account
              on the Website deactivated. Whatever the case, Grand Care Health
              Technologies will have the exclusive discretion over any refund of
              Wallet to the User's wallet account. Grand Care Health
              Technologies retains the right to prevent the transfer of any
              wallet to a user's wallet account if Grand Care Health
              Technologies suspects any fraudulent activity.
