                        <p>2.1 To make sure that the Product is shipped and delivered to you, we collaborate with third-party logistic service providers (referred to as "Logistic Partners"). When a Product is processed and successfully handed over to the Logistic Partner by us, we will offer the contact information for the Logistic Partners who will handle the shipping and delivery of any Product(s) purchased by you on the Website. From the time you place the Product Order on the Website, our typical shipment times are between 24 (twenty four) hours. In any scenario, the user will be given an approximate delivery date for the product they ordered from the website. When we confirm an order, we will display the expected delivery date on the order confirmation page for the user to see. We will also provide information on your orders after they have been shipped to the email address and/or mobile number you have given us or have registered with us. You acknowledge and agree that, despite the fact that we supply Products to Users via our logistic partners, we reserve the right to ship and distribute Products on our own, free from the assistance of any logistic partners or other service providers.</p>

                        <p className='mt-4'>2.3 You acknowledge and agree that while we make every effort to ship and deliver our products across India, we may, in our sole discretion, identify a limited number of places that are inaccessible for product delivery. In such unserviceable areas, neither we nor our logistic partners offer shipping and delivery services, and we might not be able to complete your orders through the website in such circumstances. When a user places an order for Products on the Website and we determine that a certain area is not functional, we will let them know. By inputting the appropriate area's pin code on the website, you may also determine whether a location is unserviceable for deliveries by us.
                        </p>

                        <p>2.4 You agree and accept that we may ask for or gather certain information, such as your name, shipping address, billing address, landmarks, contact information, etc. to ensure prompt delivery of the ordered Products to you. You are responsible for making sure that all information you provide to us on the website is true, complete, accurate, and sufficient to pinpoint the precise delivery location. You are aware that if we are unable to deliver the purchased Products to you as a result of your failure to supply accurate, complete, and adequate information at the time of placing the order, you will be held entirely responsible. Furthermore, it is made clear that we won't be held responsible for your failure to give accurate and comprehensive information in any way or at any time.</p>

                        <p>
                            2.5 We'll make an effort to deliver the ordered Product to the address you specified within the advised delivery window. Our Logistic Partners shall attempt to deliver the ordered Product(s) to you a maximum of three times in three (three) days (each attempt occurring on a separate day), if you are not available or present to accept the delivery of the Product. We retain the right, in our sole discretion, to cancel the order for the purchased Products if the third delivery attempt is unsuccessful and you continue to be unreachable and to arrange for the return of such Product to us. We also reserve the right to withhold the shipping and delivery costs we paid for from any refunds we issue as a result of this cancellation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            2.6 Although we make reasonable efforts to deliver purchased Products to you promptly and within the timeframe communicated to you, you accept and understand that the delivery may be postponed due to:
                        </p>
                        <p>a.Logistical problems beyond of our control;</p>

                        <p>b. Inappropriate weather circumstances;</p>

                        <p>c. Political unrest, strikes, lockouts of workers, and other governmental restrictions;</p>

                        <p>d. Divine interventions like earthquakes and floods;</p>

                        <p>e. Additional unanticipated conditions.</p>

                        <p>If there is a delay, we will make a reasonable effort to notify you in writing via your registered email address and/or mobile number. We disclaim all responsibility for any damages that may result from our failure to alert you of delivery delays of products you have ordered from the Website. Furthermore, we are not obligated to make good on any claims that would otherwise result from delays in the delivery, shipping, or usage of the acquired goods.</p>

                        <p>2.7 We make an effort to treat Logistic Partners, workers, and agents with the utmost respect for ethics and integrity and to conduct ourselves in a way that reflects competence, full professionalism, and good manners. You agree and accept that we have no control over the conduct or inactions of delivery personnel and that it is impossible for us to keep an eye on each delivery executive. We shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of our delivery agents, employees, or personnel and/or the Logistic Partner or their employees, agents, or personnel including deficiency in service, wrong delivery of the Product, time taken to deliver the Product, Product package tampering, etc. since we are merely facilitating delivery of a Product purchased by you. For the sake of complete clarity, it is stated that we have no control over any uncivil behaviour on the part of our delivery personnel or the employees, agents, or personnel of the Logistic Partners. As a result, you are responsible for resolving any disputes you may have with a delivery representative or an employee, agent, or personnel of the Logistic Partners on your own. You understand and agree that you won't hold us accountable or ask us to arbitrate or resolve any problems you may have with the delivery team who is bringing the products to you.</p>

                        <p>
                            2.8 Following the processing of an order you place on the website, we provide the purchased Product to our Logistic Partner. Once the purchased Product is given to the Logistics Partner, the User will be given a special tracking identity number that will allow them to trace the progress of delivery of the purchased Products. The User can check the status and position of the ordered Product as well as the anticipated delivery date by using the tracking identity number on the Website, the Website of the Logistic Partner, and/or the mobile application of the Logistic Partner. We make every effort to ensure that the Logistic Partners update the tracking status of the purchased Products in real time, and our customer care team works closely with them to ensure that the Products are delivered to you as soon as possible. It is made clear that because we work with other service providers to offer the products, we cannot guarantee their completeness or correctness. In addition, the tracking status may contain errors due to delays in updating the data and/or other technical issues outside of our control.
                        </p>

                        <p>2.9 We reserve the right to occasionally charge or collect shipping fees for Products. Depending on the product's value, kind, delivery location, method of payment, etc., shipping costs may change. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right to obtain from the Logistic Partner the shipping and delivery charges associated with the delivery service offered by the Logistic Partner. In the event that we charge shipping expenses for the delivery of a product you have purchased, we will not reimburse these fees in response to any return request made by you. In the case that a defective, damaged, deficient, or erroneous Product has been delivered (for reasons attributable to, and accepted by, us after appropriate verification in our sole discretion), we may make an exception and pay the shipping costs. You understand and agree that upon delivery of the ordered goods to you, the title and risk of the purchased goods pass to you.</p>

                        <p>2.10 Our reverse-Logistics Partners assist with the return of purchased goods. Our reverse-Logistics Partners will get in touch with you to arrange for the collection of the purchased Products from you after receiving your request for a return of a product through the Website and having it duly recognised by us. According to our Cancellation, Return and Refund Policy, we handle exchanges and returns of purchased Products.</p>
